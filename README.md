# 🌡️ Raspberry Pi Temperature and Humidity Monitor

This project uses a **Raspberry Pi** and a **DHT11 sensor** to measure and log temperature and humidity data. It's perfect for learning about GPIO interfacing, sensor data collection, and basic Python scripting.

## 📦 Features

- Reads real-time temperature and humidity data using the DHT11 sensor
- Displays data in the terminal
- Logs readings to a CSV file for later analysis
- Can be scheduled to run periodically via `cron`
- Optional integration with a simple web interface or cloud dashboard

## 🧰 Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO)
- DHT11 Sensor
- Python 3
- Breadboard and jumper wires
